Building anything can be very rewarding. The 'Ikea effect' is something that fascinates me. Some smart guys from a few universities discovered through experiments that self-assembly impacts the evaluation of a product by its consumers. Ultimately creating things we use from scratch gives me the best feeling. For my dining area table I always wanted to have a round table, but was never able to find the exact size I wanted. So I called a friend and he helped me out. Here you can see the process, it took us only one day to make this. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/87595bf7-73a1-4ffe-8532-0d9e25e8087d.jpg)

It starts with a small drawing, an idea, and quickly develops into a bit of stress, that is usually around the time the saw blade starts up. There really is no way back, so any last minute design change decisions should be made now. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1c2341ca-084d-4f0b-8677-f5f48dcbe8b0.jpg)

After Emile cut the varnished triplex planks for me, I shaved off a tiny bit of the edges, to be abele to create a 'v' shape when the planks connect, due to the change in color.

Arranging the shapes in a way that connects in an interesting way was next up. But again, interesting is different for anyone. But this is the kind of thing an Ikea table build will not allow you to do. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/08e192c8-1707-4bc8-a16d-857da3a2d735.jpg)
