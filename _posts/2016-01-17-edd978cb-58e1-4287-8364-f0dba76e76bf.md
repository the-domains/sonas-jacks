Building anything can be very rewarding. The 'Ikea effect' is something that fascinates me. Some smart guys from a few universities discovered through experiments that self-assembly impacts the evaluation of a product by its consumers. Ultimately creating things we use from scratch gives me the best feeling. For my dining area table I always wanted to have a round table, but was never able to find the exact size I wanted. So I called a friend and he helped me out. Here you can see the process, it took us only one day to make this. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/87595bf7-73a1-4ffe-8532-0d9e25e8087d.jpg)
